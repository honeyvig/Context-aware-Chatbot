# Context-aware-Chatbot
with experience in LLMs (Large Language Models), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for backend development, as well as some frontend development skills. The task is to develop a chatbot using the OpenAI API that delivers context-aware, knowledge-backed responses. Project Scope and Requirements: The chatbot will support two main interaction modes: 1. Guided Mode: Users will be able to upload specific templates (e.g., project reports or business plans) to guide the conversation. 2. Knowledge Interaction Mode: Users can upload multiple documents (e.g., PDFs, articles), and the chatbot will provide contextually relevant responses based on the content, including references or citations. Key Features: Vector Database Integration: Use a vector database (preferably on a cloud platform such as Google Cloud or AWS) to allow efficient document retrieval and semantic search. Prompt Management: Implement effective prompt management to optimize the chatbot's performance and ensure tailored, context-aware responses. OpenAI API Integration: Utilize OpenAI's language models to power the chatbot and handle conversations. Conversation History Management: Track conversations to improve context retention over multiple interactions. Expected Deliverables: A fully functional chatbot that supports the two interaction modes mentioned above. Integration with a vector database for document retrieval. Dynamic interaction with user-uploaded content, including citations and context-based responses. A user-friendly interface to test and interact with the chatbot. Timeline: The project should be completed within 2 weeks, with the following phases: 1. Phase 1: Setup of the basic chatbot framework with initial conversation capabilities. 2. Phase 2: Integration of the vector database for document retrieval and testing dynamic content interactions. 3. Phase 3: Finalize the prompt management and conversation history, ensuring the chatbot provides accurate and context-aware responses.

Here's a structured implementation plan for developing a context-aware chatbot using the OpenAI API, including the integration of a vector database and supporting both guided and knowledge interaction modes.
Implementation Plan for Context-Aware Chatbot
Overview

The chatbot will consist of two main interaction modes: Guided Mode for structured templates and Knowledge Interaction Mode for dynamically interacting with user-uploaded documents. We will integrate a vector database for efficient document retrieval, manage prompts for optimal responses, and maintain conversation history for context.
Timeline: 2 Weeks
Phase 1: Basic Chatbot Framework (Days 1-4)

Tasks:

    Environment Setup:
        Set up a Python environment with necessary libraries: Flask, OpenAI, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy for database interaction.
        Create a GitHub repository for version control.

    Basic Chatbot Implementation:
        Develop a simple Flask application to handle user inputs and return responses.
        Integrate the OpenAI API for generating responses.

    User Interface:
        Create a basic HTML/CSS interface for users to interact with the chatbot.
        Include input fields for users to enter their messages and buttons for switching modes.

    Initial Conversation Logic:
        Implement basic logic to switch between Guided Mode and Knowledge Interaction Mode.

Sample Code:

python

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import openai

app = Flask(__name__)

openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    user_input = request.json['message']
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]
    )
    return jsonify({"response": response.choices[0].message['content']})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Phase 2: Vector Database Integration (Days 5-10)

Tasks:

    Select a Vector Database:
        Choose a cloud-based vector database like Pinecone or Weaviate.

    Integrate Vector Database:
        Set up the vector database and create a schema for storing document embeddings.
        Use a library like faiss or the databaseâ€™s SDK to manage embeddings.

    Document Upload and Embedding:
        Implement functionality for users to upload documents (e.g., PDFs, text files).
        Extract text from documents and create embeddings using OpenAI's embeddings endpoint.

    Semantic Search Implementation:
        Develop a function to retrieve relevant documents based on user queries using vector similarity.

Sample Code for Document Upload:

python

from flask import Flask, request
import openai

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_document():
    file = request.files['document']
    text = extract_text_from_pdf(file)  # Implement this function
    embedding = openai.Embedding.create(input=text, model="text-embedding-ada-002")
    # Store embedding in the vector database
    store_embedding_in_db(embedding)  # Implement this function
    return jsonify({"message": "Document uploaded successfully."})

Phase 3: Finalization and Testing (Days 11-14)

Tasks:

    Prompt Management:
        Develop a system for managing and optimizing prompts based on user interactions and document context.

    Conversation History Management:
        Implement a mechanism to track user conversations, maintaining context across interactions. This could involve storing conversation history in a database or in-memory structure.

    Testing and Debugging:
        Conduct thorough testing of the chatbot functionalities in both modes.
        Ensure proper handling of edge cases and unexpected user inputs.

    User Interface Enhancements:
        Improve the UI for better usability, including features for displaying citations and context-based responses.

    Documentation and Deployment:
        Write comprehensive documentation for usage and API endpoints.
        Deploy the application using a platform like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.

Sample Code for Conversation History:

python

conversation_history = []

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    user_input = request.json['message']
    conversation_history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
    
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=conversation_history
    )
    
    bot_response = response.choices[0].message['content']
    conversation_history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": bot_response})
    
    return jsonify({"response": bot_response})

Expected Deliverables

    Fully Functional Chatbot: A chatbot that can interact in both Guided and Knowledge Interaction modes.
    Vector Database Integration: Efficient document retrieval mechanism using a vector database.
    Dynamic Interaction: Capability to provide context-aware responses with citations.
    User-Friendly Interface: A web-based interface for users to upload documents and interact with the chatbot.

Summary

This implementation plan outlines a structured approach to develop a context-aware chatbot using the OpenAI API, integrated with a vector database for document retrieval. Each phase focuses on key functionalities and culminates in a comprehensive system that supports both guided and knowledge-based interactions. By following this plan, we can ensure a systematic development process that meets the project requirements.
